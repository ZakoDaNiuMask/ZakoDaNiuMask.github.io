## Compilation error when invoking the  `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE`  macro {#MODULE-DEVICE-TABLE}

The error occurs because the `input handler` **in the kernel source code** is corrupted, which prevents the parameter type verification and syntax parsing from executing normally during macro invocation.

Please add the corresponding calls to the kernel source code according to [the document](manual-integrate.md#input-hooks)

## Module not working {#MODULE-NOT-WORKING}

::: info Notes
This part is only answered for modules which is require sepolicy changes. Like LSPosed/ZygiskNext module will have this problem.
:::

Since the ZakoDaNiuMask commit [`436d333`](https://github.com/ZakoDaNiuMask/ZakoDaNiuMask/commit/436d333) onwards, due to the refactoring of the sepolicy part following the upstream KernelSU, modules may not work **if either the kernel or the manager is below version 34634 or from a version prior to this commit**.

Please <mark>upgrade **both** the kernel and the manager to version 34634 or later</mark> to resolve the issue.
